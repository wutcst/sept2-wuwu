/**
 * The Game class is the main class of the "World of Zuul" application.
 * "World of Zuul" is a simple text-based adventure game. Users can explore a maze of rooms.
 * You can extend the functionality of this game to make it more interesting!
 *
 * To start playing the game, a user needs to create an instance of the Game class and call the "play" method.
 *
 * An instance of the Game class will create and initialize all other classes: it creates all the rooms
 * and connects them into a maze; it creates the parser to receive user input and convert it into commands
 * to run the game.
